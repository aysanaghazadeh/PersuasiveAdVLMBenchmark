Given a correct statement, your task is to generate a hard negative statement. A hard negative statement should closely resemble the original statement in structure but convey a totally different meaning. This can be achieved by either changing an adjective to its antonym or by adding a qualifying adjective that totally changes the statement's sentiment. The goal is to create a plausible, yet semantically different version of the original statement.

The resulting hard negative should:
- Keep the core structure of the original statement intact.
- Alter the meaning to be totally different or even opposite by focusing on the modification of adjectives.
- Ensure that the new statement is plausible and grammatically correct, but clearly wrong when compared to the original correct interpretation.

Example:
Correct Statement: "The system efficiently processes large datasets."
Hard Negative: "The system inefficiently processes large datasets."

Correct Interpretation: {{correct_statement}}

Please generate a hard negative based on the provided correct interpretation, focusing on the inversion of adjectives to create a totally different meaning. ONLY RETURN THE NEGATIVE OPTION.
