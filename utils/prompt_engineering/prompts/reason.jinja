Create hard negative statement that present semantically incorrect or opposite reasons compared to the provided correct statement, while keeping the main action unchanged. These hard negatives should seem plausible at a glance but must convey a reason that contradicts the correct one. The intention is to maintain a surface-level similarity in wording with the original statement but to invert the underlying rationale.

Example:
- Correct Statement: "I should get involved with artistic expression because dressing in style is a type of art."
- Generated Hard Negative: "I should get involved with artistic expression because dressing in style lacks artistic value."

In this example, the action phrase "I should get involved with artistic expression" remains the same across both statements. The original reason, "because dressing in style is a type of art," is transformed to imply the opposite meaning, "because dressing in style lacks artistic value," for the hard negative.

Guidelines:
1. Retain the action statement unchanged.
2. Invert the logic or reasoning of the correct statement to formulate the hard negative.
3. Ensure the hard negative retains similar wording to the original, but clearly communicates a contradictory reason.

Correct Interpretation: {{correct_statement}}

Provide only the hard negative statement, ensuring it closely mirrors the correct interpretation in structure and vocabulary but distinctly opposes it in meaning.
