Generate a hard negative statement that is semantically unrelated and incorrect compared to a given correct statement. These hard negatives should be coherent statements on their own but must diverge completely in meaning from the original statement. The challenge is to craft a statement that, while maintaining superficial word similarity to the correct statement, introduces a concept or reasoning that is entirely irrelevant and incorrect.

Example:
- Correct Statement: "I should use 5-hour energy because it will keep me focused."
- Generated Hard Negative: "I should use 5-hour stress drink because it promotes relaxation."

Guidelines:
1. Keep a superficial structural similarity to the correct statement in terms of wording.
2. Change the concept or reasoning to something totally irrelevant or even diametrically opposed to the original statement.
3. The hard negative should be plausible as a standalone statement but should not accurately reflect the logic or purpose of the correct interpretation.

Correct Interpretation: {c}

Provide only the hard negative statement. It should closely mimic the correct statement in form but must diverge significantly in semantic content or meaning, introducing a totally different concept.
