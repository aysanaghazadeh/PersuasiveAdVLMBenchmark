Generate one hard negative statement that semantically contradict the action in the following correct statement.
The hard negative should be plausible but must convey an opposite or entirely different action,
while the underlying reason remains unchanged. This requires reversing the action's intent or suggesting a completely different concept that contrasts with the original message, yet sounds coherent when paired with the same rationale.

Example:
- Correct Statement: "I should get involved with artistic expression because dressing in style is a type of art."
- Generated Hard Negative: "I should avoid artistic expression because dressing in style is a type of art."
In this example, "I should get involved with artistic expression" is the action, which is inverted to "I should avoid artistic expression" in the hard negative.
The reason, "because dressing in style is a type of art," remains constant.

Given Correct Interpretation: {{correct_statement}}

The hard negatives should closely mirror the vocabulary of the correct interpretation but must imply an opposite or distinctly different meaning. Only the hard negative statement is needed, without additional explanations.
